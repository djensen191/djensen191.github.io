This is Massively, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image (with a new parallax implementation I'm testing) and scroll effects (powered by
Scrollex). A *slight* departure from all the one-pagers I've been doing lately, but one
that fulfills a few user requests and makes use of some new techniques I've been wanting
to try out. Enjoy it :)

Credit toc AJ for designing the Massively template.  I have tweaked his design for my portfolio use.  Most of 
my changes have been content oriented.  Ie since this is a programming portfolio I tried to focus the 
linked social media platforms towards a business focus.  Also because I am hosting this on GitHub I had to do a little work to 
make the feedback forms work without the capability of server side scripting.
